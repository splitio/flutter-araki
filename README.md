# araki

A new Flutter project to show off the Split plugin for feature flags in Flutter.

Araki is the name of the creator of *Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventures*, a sleek bit of manga and anime.

## Background 

The project itself is the default Flutter example with small changes:

 - FutureBuilder is employed to wait for feature flags to be available
 - Split dynamic config describes the image and title to put on the page

If you haven't used FutureBuilder, it allows a progress screen while the
data is fetched.  If an error occurs, an error screen is show.  Otherwise,
the main user interface is displayed using the data fetched.
